# Open-WebUI Claude Caching

Adds prefix caching support to the [Open-WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) LLM front-end for Anthropic Claude LaaS (LLM as a service) [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models).

See the Anthropic [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#pricing)
for pros and cons as it relates to using caching and cost.

To enable the claude models in the first place (if you haven't already), I recommend adding [this](https://openwebui.com/f/justinrahb/anthropic) 
function first, which will add support for them to the webui.

The function is also published on the Open-WebUI [website](https://openwebui.com/f/jojje/claude_caching).

Happy $$$ savings.
